# Phone Book Management System in C++
Welcome to the Phone Book Management System project, created as part of my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) coursework. This project demonstrates advanced concepts in data structures, focusing on AVL Trees and Hash Tables for efficient contact management. The system allows users to add, search, delete, and update contact information seamlessly.

## Project Highlights:
**📱 Efficient Contact Management:** Utilize AVL Trees and Hash Tables for quick and efficient contact operations.

**🌳 AVL Tree Implementation:** Ensures balanced binary search trees for optimized insertion, deletion, and search operations.

**🔑 Hash Table Utilization:** Provides a fast and efficient way to handle large datasets through hash-based indexing.

**🛠️ Modular Code Design:** Demonstrates modular programming with well-defined classes and functions for each data structure.

**📈 Performance Measurement:** Incorporates time measurement for search operations to evaluate efficiency.

## Key Features:
**📂 AVL Tree Operations:**

**Add Contact:** Inserts a new contact while maintaining tree balance.

**Search Contact:** Efficiently searches for a contact, measuring the time taken.

**Delete Contact:** Removes a contact and rebalances the tree.

**Update Contact:** Updates existing contact information.
**🔍 Hash Table Operations:**

**Add Contact:** Inserts a new contact using hash-based indexing.

**Search Contact:** Efficiently searches for a contact, measuring the time taken.

**Delete Contact:** Removes a contact from the hash table.

**Update Contact:** Updates existing contact information.
## How to Use:
## Load the System:
Run the program and choose the data structure (AVL Tree or Hash Table).
**Choose an Operation:**
**Add Contact:** Enter a new phone number to add to the system.

**Search Contact:** Enter a phone number to search and retrieve the contact.

**Delete Contact:** Enter a phone number to delete the contact.

**Update Contact:** Enter an old phone number and a new one to update the contact.

**View Results**: The system will display the results of your operations, including the time taken for search operations.

# Technologies Used:
